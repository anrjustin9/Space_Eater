# Space_Eater
Simple C++ program designed to eat free space within seconds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple little (about 2MB) C++11 (so make sure and add the -std=11 to the compiler parameters) program designed to create multiple file.img(1.2GB) which will eventually fill an entire hard drive. The loop is set to 20 so it will not fill more than 30GB. The attributes to the contents of the root folder will automatically be set to -h to hide the files.
